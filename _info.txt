[HTTP Codes]
- 200: OK. The standard success code and default option.
- 201: Object created. Useful for the store actions.
- 204: No content. When an action was executed successfully, but there is no content to return.
- 206: Partial content. Useful when you have to return a paginated list of resources.
- 400: Bad request. The standard option for requests that fail to pass validation.
- 401: Unauthorized. The user needs to be authenticated.
- 403: Forbidden. The user is authenticated, but does not have the permissions to perform an action.
- 404: Not found. This will be returned automatically by Laravel when the resource is not found.
- 500: Internal server error. Ideally you're not going to be explicitly returning this, but if something unexpected breaks, this is what your user is going to receive.
- 503: Service unavailable. Pretty self explanatory, but also another code that is not going to be returned explicitly by the application.
